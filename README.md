This is a fun little project that I have created to test out github and some survival modeling techniques with some multiple imputation thrown in.

There are some prototype of the analysis here but the only file that you will need to read is "Survival analysis on stroke data.pdf" which contains the final analysis.

Feel free to give any feedback! I am learning as I go.

All the best!
